All assignments placed in your InDesign document should be native illustrator files (.ai), photoshop files (.psd), and indesign files (.indd), NOT exported derivative files.

Make sure that any type in illustrator has been converted to outlines or include the typeface(s) in the folder(s) instead.

Make sure that images are included if they are not embedded within illustrator.

**To do this in InDesign, use the PACKAGE (File->Package) command in InDesign. See the InDesign video tutorial here: https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/how-to/indesign-package-files-for-handoff.html**
