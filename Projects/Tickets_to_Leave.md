### TICKETS TO LEAVE


At the end of each class period, when instructed, send me a Slack direct message and answer **both** of the following questions:

* What is the most important point you learned today in class or what is something you learned that you didn't know before?
* What concept(s) confused you from today’s lecture or exercises, or what do you have further questions about?
  * (This will give you a clue as to what you should study before the next class.)
